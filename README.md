# Data Mining - DATA3421 Spring 2025

In this class, we discovered trends, patterns, correlations, and other useful information from the data sets that we were given and applied machine learning, statistics, and database systems like SQL in our processes. Below is an overview of what we completed in each project.

## Diabetes Project
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting diabetes outcomes using clinical and demographic data. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques, the project identifies key risk factors influencing diabetes and develops predictive models to classify patients at risk. The outcomes provide actionable insights for early detection and improved healthcare interventions.

## Townhome Dataset Project
This project involves analyzing a dataset of townhome listings to uncover patterns in pricing, features, and market trends. Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, the project provides insights into factors that affect property values. Additionally, predictive modeling techniques are applied to estimate townhome prices, supporting real estate decision-making.
